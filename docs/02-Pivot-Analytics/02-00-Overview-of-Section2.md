#  Section 2 - Pivot Analitics

From the outcome of Section 1, now you can see data on a grid. You can check numbers on grouped / summarized / filtered recoreds on a grid, but the operation would be quite hard if you want to analize multiple data dimensions and to slice / to drill down them on a grid UI. In that case, Pivot UI would be suitable to analize data like that way.

In this section, you quickly build Pivot Analitics UI with XamPivotGird, XamPivotDataSelector, XamPivotDataSlicer and XamDataChart in Pivot.xaml.
